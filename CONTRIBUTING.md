# Contributing to SourceLensAI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SourceLensAI! We appreciate your support and enthusiasm.

At this early stage of the project, we are focusing on stabilizing the core architecture and are **not actively accepting external contributions** such as pull requests or feature suggestions. This allows our team to establish a solid foundation before opening up for broader community involvement.

While we aren't accepting code, you can still help us immensely! We encourage you to:

-   **Watch** the repository to stay updated on our progress.
-   **Star** the project if you find it interesting.
-   **Use** the tool and help us find critical bugs. Please report them by **creating a new issue in the "Issues" tab** of this repository. Your feedback is most valuable for problems like:
    *   **Crashes or freezes** that stop the application.
    *   **Installation problems** that prevent you from getting started.
    *   **Core features not working** as expected.
    *   **Incorrect results** that make the output unusable.

    To help us prioritize, please hold off on creating issues for minor cosmetic improvements or new feature requests for now.

We will update this document as soon as we are ready to accept all types of contributions. Thank you for your understanding!
