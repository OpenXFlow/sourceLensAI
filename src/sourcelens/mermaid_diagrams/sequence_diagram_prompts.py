        "**1. DIAGRAM START:**\n"
        "   - First line MUST be exactly `sequenceDiagram`\n"
        "   - No extra text, comments, or formatting before this line\n\n"
        "**2. PARTICIPANTS:**\n"
        "   - Use simple names: `participant User`, `participant API`\n"
        "   - Avoid quotes, spaces, or special characters in names\n"
        "   - Declare all participants at the start (optional but recommended)\n\n"
        "**3. MESSAGE SYNTAX:**\n"
        "   - Synchronous call: `A->>B: Message`\n"
        "   - Response/return: `B-->>A: Response`\n"
        "   - Async call: `A-)B: Async message`\n"
        "   - Self-call: `A->>A: Internal process`\n\n"
        "**4. ACTIVATION RULES (CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY):**\n"
        "   - Rule #1: A participant can ONLY be activated if it's currently INACTIVE\n"
        "   - Rule #2: A participant can ONLY be deactivated if it's currently ACTIVE\n"
        "   - Rule #3: Each activate MUST have exactly ONE matching deactivate\n"
        "   - Rule #4: Track state mentally: INACTIVE ‚Üí activate ‚Üí ACTIVE ‚Üí deactivate ‚Üí INACTIVE\n\n"
        "**5. ALT/ELSE BLOCK RULES (MOST COMMON ERROR SOURCE):**\n"
        "   - SAFE APPROACH: Avoid activate/deactivate inside alt/else blocks entirely\n"
        "   - IF you must activate inside alt/else:\n"
        "     * Activate in ONE branch only\n"
        "     * Deactivate in the SAME branch\n"
        "     * NEVER deactivate the same participant in multiple branches\n"
        "   - PREFERRED: Do all activation/deactivation outside alt/else blocks\n\n"
        "**6. OTHER CONTROL STRUCTURES:**\n"
        "   - Same rules apply for `loop`, `par`, `opt`, `critical` blocks\n"
        "   - Always close blocks with `end`\n"
        "   - Keep activation logic simple within these blocks\n\n"
        "**7. VALIDATION CHECKLIST:**\n"
        "   - Count activates vs deactivates for each participant (must be equal)\n"
        "   - Ensure no participant is activated twice without deactivation\n"
        "   - Ensure no participant is deactivated when already inactive\n"
        "   - Check that all control blocks end with `end`"
