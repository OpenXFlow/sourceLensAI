# Chapter 1: Crawl4AI Quick Start Guide
Let's delve deeper into this concept. This chapter provides a streamlined introduction to Crawl4AI, outlining the initial steps for setting up and executing a basic crawl. It is designed for users who want to quickly get started and see the tool in action.
## Navigating the Crawl4AI Documentation
The Crawl4AI documentation, version 0.6.x, serves as the primary resource for understanding and utilizing the tool. It offers a comprehensive guide covering various aspects, from basic setup to advanced features. Key sections accessible from the documentation include:
*   **Home:** Provides an overview of Crawl4AI.
*   **Ask AI:** Explores AI integration features within Crawl4AI.
*   **LLM Context:** Focuses on how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used in conjunction with Crawl4AI.
*   **Quick Start:** Offers a brief introduction and guide, which this chapter aims to expand upon.
*   **Code Examples:** Provides practical code snippets demonstrating how to use Crawl4AI's features.
*   **Setup & Installation:** Guides users through the installation process, including standard installation and Docker deployment.
*   **Core:** Covers fundamental concepts such as the Command Line Interface (CLI), simple and deep crawling, crawler result analysis, browser and LLM configuration, and more.
*   **Advanced:** Explores advanced features like file downloading, lazy loading, proxy security, session management, and multi-URL crawling.
*   **Extraction:** Details various strategies for extracting content, including LLM-free and LLM-based approaches.
*   **Blog & Changelog:** Keeps users updated on the latest news, updates, and changes to Crawl4AI.
## Installation and Setup
Before using Crawl4AI, proper installation and setup are necessary. The documentation links to detailed guides for both standard installation and Docker deployment. Refer to the "[Installation](https://docs.crawl4ai.com/core/installation/)" and "[Docker Deployment](https://docs.crawl4ai.com/core/docker-deployment/)" sections within the documentation for detailed instructions. Choosing the right installation method depends on your system configuration and preferences. Docker deployment offers a containerized environment, ensuring consistency across different systems, while standard installation provides direct access to the tool on your machine.
## Core Crawling Concepts
Understanding the core crawling concepts is essential for effective use of Crawl4AI. These concepts include:
*   **Command Line Interface (CLI):** Crawl4AI can be controlled via a CLI, allowing users to specify crawl parameters and execute crawls from the command line. More information about using the CLI can be found in [Using the Crawl4AI Command-Line Interface (CLI)](02_using-the-crawl4ai-command-line.md).
*   **Simple Crawling:** Refers to basic crawling functionalities, where the tool crawls a website based on specified parameters, such as the starting URL and depth.
*   **Deep Crawling:** Involves recursively crawling a website to a greater depth, following links and extracting information from multiple pages. More information about deep crawling can be found in [Implementing Deep Crawling](08_implementing-deep-crawling.md).
*   **Crawler Result:** Represents the data collected during a crawl, including extracted content, links, and metadata. Understanding the structure of the results is covered in [Understanding Crawl Result Data](04_understanding-crawl-result-data.md).
*   **Browser, Crawler & LLM Config:** Crawl4AI allows configuration of the browser used for crawling, as well as crawler settings and integration with LLMs for advanced content extraction.
## Advanced Features Overview
Crawl4AI provides several advanced features that extend its capabilities beyond basic crawling. These include:
*   **File Downloading:** Enables the downloading of files encountered during a crawl, such as images, documents, and other media. Detailed instructions about downloading files can be found in [Downloading Files with Crawl4AI](05_downloading-files-with-crawl4ai.md).
*   **Lazy Loading:** Handles websites that use lazy loading techniques, where content is loaded dynamically as the user scrolls.
*   **Proxy & Security:** Supports the use of proxies to anonymize crawling activity and enhance security. Information about implementing proxy security can be found in [Implementing Proxy Security](09_implementing-proxy-security.md).
*   **Session Management:** Provides tools for managing sessions during crawling, allowing the tool to maintain state and interact with websites that require authentication. Managing sessions is covered in [Managing Sessions in Crawl4AI](06_managing-sessions-in-crawl4ai.md).
*   **Multi-URL Crawling:** Enables crawling multiple URLs simultaneously or sequentially.
## Content Extraction Strategies
Crawl4AI offers different strategies for extracting content from web pages. These strategies can be broadly categorized into LLM-free and LLM-based approaches.
*   **LLM-Free Strategies:** Involve using traditional methods, such as CSS selectors and XPath expressions, to identify and extract specific elements from a web page.
*   **LLM Strategies:** Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the content of a web page and extract information based on natural language queries or prompts. Using Crawl4AI with LLM strategies is covered in [Using Crawl4AI with LLM Strategies](12_using-crawl4ai-with-llm-strategies.md) and [Leveraging LLMs for Content Extraction](11_leveraging-llms-for-content-extraction.md).
This concludes our overview of this topic.
