## Description

The honeymoon phase for vibe coding is over and context engineering is the new paradigm for AI coding. Earlier this year we all fell for the vibe coding but it completely falls apart when you try to build anything real or scale it up. The biggest problem? AI coding assistants miss context or lack it entirely, and intuition doesn't scale - structure does.

Context engineering treats your instructions, rules, and documentation as an engineered resource requiring careful architecture, just like everything else in real software. It's not just prompt engineering - it's supplying all the relevant facts, knowledge, rules, plans, and tools so an LLM can actually accomplish the task at hand.

In this video, I dive deep into what context engineering actually looks like and then we jump into the lab with Claude Code to show you how it works with a real practical example. Like Abraham Lincoln said - if you have six hours to chop a tree, spend four sharpening your axe. That's exactly what we're doing here, and the results are infinitely better than diving straight into implementation.
