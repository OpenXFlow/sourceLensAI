# Chapter 6: Data Validation and Error Handling
Let's begin exploring this concept. The goal of this chapter is to understand how `20250704_1434_code-sourcelensai` ensures data integrity and handles errors gracefully. This is crucial for building a robust and reliable application that can withstand unexpected inputs and situations.
Imagine building a house. You wouldn't just start throwing bricks together without a blueprint and quality checks, would you? Data validation and error handling in software are like that blueprint and quality control â€“ they ensure that the "bricks" (data) are the right shape and size, and that if something goes wrong, the construction crew (your program) doesn't just collapse.
Specifically, in `20250704_1434_code-sourcelensai`, this abstraction is responsible for:
*   **Validating data against predefined schemas:** Ensuring that the data received from LLMs or configuration files conforms to expected structures and types.
*   **Handling errors during file processing:** Preventing crashes or unexpected behavior when dealing with corrupted or malformed files.
*   **Providing informative error messages:** Helping developers and users understand what went wrong and how to fix it.
## Key Concepts
This chapter will cover the following key areas:
1.  **YAML Extraction:** How the system extracts YAML code blocks from potentially noisy LLM output.
2.  **Schema Validation (JSON Schema):** How JSON Schema is used to validate the structure and content of YAML data.
3.  **Custom Exceptions:** The custom exceptions used to signal specific error conditions within the application.
4.  **Error Handling Strategies:** The techniques used to catch and handle errors gracefully, preventing crashes and providing informative messages.
## Usage / How it Works
The core of the data validation and error handling logic resides in the `src/sourcelens/utils/validation.py` file. This file provides functions for extracting YAML blocks from strings and validating them against expected types (list, dictionary) and optional JSON schemas.
The `validate_yaml_list` and `validate_yaml_dict` functions are the primary entry points for validating data received from LLMs. These functions perform the following steps:
1.  **Extract YAML:** Use regular expressions to extract the YAML code block from the raw LLM output.
2.  **Parse YAML:** Parse the YAML string into a Python data structure (list or dictionary).
3.  **Validate Schema (Optional):** If a JSON schema is provided, validate the parsed data against the schema.
4.  **Return Validated Data:** Return the validated data structure.
If any of these steps fail, a `ValidationFailure` exception is raised, providing information about the error.

                alt Schema validation fails
                    Validator-->>User Code: Raise ValidationFailure
                    deactivate Validator
                else Schema validation succeeds
                end
            end
            Validator-->>User Code: Return validated dictionary
            deactivate Validator
        end
    end
```
*This sequence diagram illustrates the flow of the `validate_yaml_dict` function. It shows how the function extracts, parses, and validates the YAML data, raising a `ValidationFailure` if any errors occur.*
## Code Examples
Let's look at some code examples to illustrate how these functions are used.
```python
# Example: Validating a YAML dictionary
import logging
from src.sourcelens.utils.validation import validate_yaml_dict, ValidationFailure
# Assuming you have configured logging (see Chapter 1)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
raw_llm_output = """
```yaml
name: "My Project"
version: "1.0.0"
description: "A simple project"
```
"""
dict_schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {"type": "string"},
        "version": {"type": "string"},
        "description": {"type": "string"},
    },
    "required": ["name", "version", "description"],
}
try:
    validated_data = validate_yaml_dict(raw_llm_output, dict_schema)
    print(f"Validated data: {validated_data}")
except ValidationFailure as e:
    logger.error(f"Validation failed: {e}")
# Expected Output (if validation succeeds):
# Validated data: {'name': 'My Project', 'version': '1.0.0', 'description': 'A simple project'}
```
*This code snippet shows how to use `validate_yaml_dict` to validate a YAML dictionary against a JSON schema. The `try...except` block catches any `ValidationFailure` exceptions that may be raised.*
```python
# Example: Handling LlmApiError
from src.sourcelens.utils._exceptions import LlmApiError
try:
    # Simulate an LLM API call that fails
    raise LlmApiError("Failed to connect to the LLM API", status_code=500, provider="OpenAI")
except LlmApiError as e:
    print(f"LLM API error: {e}")
    # You might want to retry the API call, log the error, or take other appropriate actions.
# Expected output:
# LLM API error: LLM API Error (OpenAI): Failed to connect to the LLM API (Status: 500)
```
*This code shows how to catch and handle the custom `LlmApiError` exception. This allows you to gracefully handle errors that occur during LLM API calls.*
## Relationships & Cross-Linking
The data validation and error handling mechanisms are closely related to other modules in the project. For example:
*   **Configuration Management ([Configuration Management](01_configuration-management.md)):** The configuration files are validated against a predefined schema to ensure that they are correctly formatted.
*   **LLM API Abstraction ([LLM API Abstraction](03_llm-api-abstraction.md)):** The responses from the LLM API are validated to ensure that they conform to the expected structure and content.
*   **File Fetching ([File Fetching](02_file-fetching.md)):** When fetching files, errors are handled to prevent crashes and provide informative messages.
## Conclusion
In summary, data validation and error handling are essential for building robust and reliable applications. In `20250704_1434_code-sourcelensai`, these mechanisms are used to ensure data integrity, handle errors gracefully, and provide informative error messages. Understanding these concepts will help you build a better and more resilient application.
This concludes our look at this topic.
