# Chapter 7: Shell Scripting Fundamentals (Bash/PowerShell)
Let's begin exploring this concept. This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of shell scripting, focusing on Bash (typically used in Linux/macOS environments) and PowerShell (primarily used in Windows). These scripting languages are crucial for automating tasks within the `20250708_1421_code-shell-scripting-sample-project`.
**Motivation/Purpose**
Think of shell scripting as the glue that binds different programs and commands together. Instead of manually typing commands into a terminal every time you want to perform a series of actions, you can write a script that executes those commands automatically. It's like creating a recipe for your computer to follow. This automation saves time, reduces errors, and allows for repeatable processes. Imagine having to manually back up your files every day versus running a script that does it for you with a single command!
**Key Concepts Breakdown**
Shell scripts are plain text files containing a sequence of commands. Here are some essential concepts:
*   **Variables:** Store data for later use. Variables hold values like file paths, numbers, or strings.
*   **Conditional Statements (if/else):** Allow your script to make decisions based on certain conditions. If a condition is true, one set of commands is executed; otherwise, another set is executed.
*   **Loops (for/while):** Repeat a block of code multiple times. This is useful for iterating over lists of files, processing data, or performing repetitive tasks.
*   **Command Execution:** The core of shell scripting involves running other programs and utilities. Scripts capture the output and exit codes of these commands, allowing them to react accordingly.
*   **Functions:** Create reusable blocks of code within a script. This promotes modularity and makes scripts easier to maintain.
*   **Input/Output Redirection:** Manipulate the standard input, output, and error streams of commands. This allows scripts to read from files, write to files, and handle errors gracefully.
**Usage / How it Works**
Shell scripts work by interpreting the commands within the script and executing them in the order they appear. The shell (Bash or PowerShell) acts as an intermediary between the script and the operating system.
1.  **Shebang:** Most scripts start with a "shebang" (`#!`) line that specifies the interpreter to use. For example, `#!/bin/bash` indicates that the script should be executed using the Bash interpreter. For PowerShell, the shebang is typically not used on Windows; however, on Linux with PowerShell, it would be `#!/usr/bin/env pwsh`.
2.  **Permissions:** Scripts typically need execute permissions to be run. You can set these permissions using the `chmod` command on Linux/macOS (e.g., `chmod +x my_script.sh`). On Windows, the file association with PowerShell allows `.ps1` scripts to run.
3.  **Execution:** To run a Bash script, you would typically use `./my_script.sh` (if in the same directory) or `bash my_script.sh`. To run a PowerShell script, you would use `.\my_script.ps1`.
**Code Examples (Short & Essential)**
Here are some simple examples illustrating basic shell scripting concepts.
```python
--- File: linux/example.sh ---
#!/bin/bash
# Assign a value to a variable
NAME="World"
# Print a greeting
echo "Hello, $NAME!"
# Conditional statement
if [ $NAME == "World" ]; then
  echo "This is a default greeting."
else
  echo "This is a personalized greeting."
fi
# Loop
for i in 1 2 3; do
  echo "Iteration: $i"
done
```
This Bash example demonstrates variable assignment, conditional statements (`if`), and a `for` loop.
```python
--- File: windows/example.ps1 ---
# Assign a value to a variable
$Name = "World"
# Print a greeting
Write-Host "Hello, $Name!"
# Conditional statement
if ($Name -eq "World") {
  Write-Host "This is a default greeting."
} else {
  Write-Host "This is a personalized greeting."
}
# Loop
foreach ($i in 1, 2, 3) {
  Write-Host "Iteration: $i"
}
```
This PowerShell example showcases similar concepts, using PowerShell syntax. Note the different syntax for variable assignment (`$Name = ...`), conditional checks (`$Name -eq ...`), and loop syntax (`foreach`).
**Relationships & Cross-Linking**
As you progress through this tutorial, you'll see how shell scripting is used extensively. For example, [Environment Variables](02_environment-variables.md) are often used within scripts to configure their behavior. You'll also see how scripts are managed using [Git Version Control](03_git-version-control.md). Subsequent chapters will cover specific scripts used in the project, such as the [Backup Script](04_backup-script.md), [Deployment Script](05_deployment-script.md), and [Monitoring Script](06_monitoring-script.md). Finally, [Makefile Orchestration](07_makefile-orchestration.md) shows how scripts can be orchestrated and managed through Makefiles.
**Conclusion**
Understanding the fundamentals of shell scripting is essential for working with the `20250708_1421_code-shell-scripting-sample-project`. By mastering these concepts, you'll be able to automate tasks, streamline workflows, and improve the overall efficiency of your development process. This concludes our look at this topic.
