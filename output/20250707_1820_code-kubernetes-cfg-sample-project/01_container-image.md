# Chapter 1: Container Image
Let's begin exploring this concept. In this chapter, we will delve into the idea of a "Container Image" and how it's used within the `20250707_1820_code-kubernetes-cfg-sample-project`.
**Why Container Images?**
Imagine you are packing up an application and all its dependencies to ship to a friend. Instead of just sending the code, which might not work on their system, you package everything: the code itself, the specific versions of libraries it needs, the runtime environment (like Python or Node.js), and even system tools. This self-contained package ensures your application runs consistently, regardless of where it's deployed.
That's essentially what a container image is! It's a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything an application needs to run. Container images solve the "it works on my machine" problem, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
**Key Concepts:**
A container image comprises:
*   **Code:** The application code itself.
*   **Runtime:** The environment needed to run the code (e.g., Python interpreter, Java Virtual Machine).
*   **System Tools:** Utilities needed by the application.
*   **System Libraries:** Shared libraries the application depends on.
*   **Settings:** Configuration files and environment variables.
**How it Works in this Project**
In the `20250707_1820_code-kubernetes-cfg-sample-project`, container images are used as the base for creating Pods, which are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. Specifically, we define container images for the frontend and Redis components of our application.
The project uses Helm to manage Kubernetes deployments. The container images are specified in the `values.yaml` file and referenced within the deployment templates.
Here's an example from `guestbook-chart/values.yaml`:
```python
---
frontend:
  replicaCount: 1
  image: "gcr.io/google-samples/gb-frontend:v4"
  port: 80
redis:
  leader:
    replicaCount: 1
    image: "redis:6.0.5"
    port: 6379
  follower:
    replicaCount: 2
    image: "redis:6.0.5"
    port: 6379
```
This snippet shows that the frontend uses the image `gcr.io/google-samples/gb-frontend:v4`, and the Redis components use `redis:6.0.5`. These images are pulled from a container registry (like Docker Hub or Google Container Registry) when the application is deployed.
The deployment templates then reference these values:
```python
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-frontend
  labels:
    {{- include "guestbook.labels" . | nindent 8 }}
    app.kubernetes.io/component: frontend
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.frontend.replicaCount }}
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/component: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        {{- include "guestbook.labels" . | nindent 12 }}
        app.kubernetes.io/component: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: php-redis
        image: {{ .Values.frontend.image }} # <--- Image referenced here
        ports:
        - containerPort: {{ .Values.frontend.port }}
```
The `{{ .Values.frontend.image }}` placeholder in the `frontend-deployment.yaml` file is replaced with the actual image name defined in the `values.yaml` file when Helm renders the template.
**Relationship to Other Concepts**
Understanding container images is fundamental to grasping how Pods, Deployments, and other Kubernetes resources work. Images are the building blocks upon which these resources are built. For more on Pods, see [Pod](03_pod.md). We will see in [Deployment](04_deployment.md) how deployments manage these images and their replicas, configured through [Values (Helm)](07_values-helm.md) and templated with [Helm Chart](08_helm-chart.md).
This concludes our look at this topic.
