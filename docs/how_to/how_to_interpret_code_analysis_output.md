# How to Interpret the Code Analysis Output

This guide explains how to get the most value from the documentation generated by `sourceLens`'s **code analysis flow (`FL01`)**. The output is designed to be a structured tutorial, helping you quickly grasp the architecture and key concepts of any analyzed codebase.

### 1. The Output Directory Structure

After a successful `sourcelens code` run, a new directory is created inside your configured `output` folder (e.g., `output/20250627_1030_code-my-project/`). Inside, you will find the following key files:

```
output/your-project-name/
├── 01_some_abstraction.md
├── 02_another_abstraction.md
├── ... (more numbered chapters)
├── diagrams.md
├── code_inventory.md
├── project_review.md
└── index.md
```

### 2. Your Starting Point: `index.md`

Always start by opening `index.md`. This file is the main entry point to your generated documentation and contains three crucial sections:

*   **AI-Generated Summary:** A high-level overview of the project's purpose and how its main components interact. This gives you an immediate sense of what the project does.
*   **Abstraction Relationship Flowchart:** This is a Mermaid diagram showing the key conceptual components ("Abstractions") and the relationships between them. Think of it as a 30,000-foot view of the project's architecture, ideal for understanding the main data or control flows.
*   **Chapters List:** A navigable table of contents that links to every generated chapter file. The chapters are listed in a logical, pedagogical order suggested by the AI to guide you from foundational concepts to more specific ones.

### 3. Navigating the Tutorial: The Chapters

The numbered Markdown files (`01_...`, `02_...`) form the core of the tutorial.

*   **Logical Order:** The numbering is intentional. It represents a recommended learning path. Start with `01_...` and follow the "Next" and "Previously..." links to progress through the material logically.
*   **Chapter Focus:** Each chapter explains a single **Abstraction**—a key component like a class, a module, or a high-level concept. It details the abstraction's purpose and its role in the overall project.
*   **Navigation Links:** At the top and bottom of each chapter, you will find "Previously..." and "Next..." links, allowing you to move through the tutorial sequentially without returning to the index.

### 4. Understanding the Special Chapters

In addition to the standard chapters, `sourceLens` generates high-value summary files that provide deeper insights. These are also linked from `index.md`.

#### `diagrams.md`
This file consolidates all major architectural diagrams generated by the LLM. It may contain:
*   **Class Diagram:** Shows the key classes, their attributes, methods, and inheritance/composition relationships. Useful for a detailed object-oriented perspective.
*   **Package Diagram:** Illustrates the dependencies between different modules or packages, helping you understand the high-level project structure.
*   **Sequence Diagrams:** Visualizes specific interaction scenarios (e.g., "User Login Process"). These are invaluable for understanding how different components collaborate to achieve a goal.

#### `code_inventory.md`
Think of this as a detailed, structured "Table of Contents" for your codebase. It provides a file-by-file breakdown, listing the classes, functions, methods, and other structural elements within each file. It's an excellent resource for quickly finding where a specific piece of logic is defined without having to manually search the entire project.

#### `project_review.md`
This file contains a holistic, AI-generated review of the project based on the analyzed abstractions and relationships.

> **CRUCIAL DISCLAIMER:** This review is an **AI's perspective**, designed to stimulate thought and discussion. It is **NOT** a definitive code audit.
>
> *   **What it IS:** A high-level take on architectural patterns, potential areas for discussion (e.g., high coupling in one area), and observed structural characteristics.
> *   **What it is NOT:** It **cannot** assess runtime behavior, performance, security vulnerabilities, code style correctness, or business logic validity.
>
> Use the review as a starting point for a human-led architectural discussion, not as a final verdict on code quality.
