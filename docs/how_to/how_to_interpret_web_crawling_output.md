# How to Interpret the Web Crawling Output

This guide explains how to understand the output generated by `sourceLens`'s **web content analysis flow (`FL02`)**. The structure and content of the output depend heavily on the `processing_mode` you select (`llm_extended` or `minimalistic`).

### 1. Output for `llm_extended` Mode (Full Analysis)

This mode performs a deep, AI-powered analysis of the crawled web content. It generates a structured summary, similar to the code analysis output.

#### Your Starting Point: `web_summary_index.md`
This is the main entry point for your web content summary. It contains:
*   **AI-Generated Summary:** A high-level overview of the main themes and arguments found across all the crawled content.
*   **Chapters List:** A navigable table of contents linking to each generated chapter. The chapters are ordered logically to present a coherent narrative.

#### The Generated Chapters
The numbered Markdown files (`01_...`, `02_...`) are the core of the summary. Each chapter focuses on a single **Concept**â€”a key topic, theme, or idea identified by the LLM from the web text. This helps distill large amounts of information into digestible sections.

#### Special Chapters (Web)
*   **`content_inventory.md`:** This file provides a breakdown of all the text "chunks" that were segmented from the original web pages. Each chunk is listed along with a concise, AI-generated summary, allowing you to quickly scan the content of the entire website.
*   **`web_content_review.md`:** This contains a high-level AI review of the web content, focusing on its structure, clarity, key themes, and potential areas for improvement or clarification.

### 2. Output for `minimalistic` Mode (Content Archiving)

This mode performs **no AI analysis**. Its sole purpose is to crawl web pages and save their content as clean, readable Markdown files. It's ideal for archiving websites or preparing content for other tools.

*   **Output Directory:** Inside your run folder (e.g., `output/20250627_1100_web-example.com/`), you will find a `page_content/` subdirectory.
*   **Contents:** This directory contains the raw Markdown conversion of each crawled page. The original URL structure is preserved as a directory path (e.g., `page_content/about/team.md`), making it easy to navigate the archived site locally.

### 3. Specific Output for YouTube Videos

When `sourceLens` analyzes a YouTube URL, it generates a unique and powerful set of outputs, combining features from both processing modes.

*   **Main Directory:**
    *   **`web_summary_index.md`:** An overview file that links to the video's content and generated transcripts.
    *   **`page_content/`:** Contains a single `pg_{video_title}.md` file. This serves as a landing page with the video's title, description, and direct links to the transcript files.

*   **`transcripts/` Subdirectory:** This is where the core value lies.
    *   **`ts_{video_title}_{lang}_orig.md`**: The **original transcript** downloaded from YouTube. This version has undergone a basic AI-powered cleaning and deduplication but **preserves time-block headers** (e.g., `#### [01:23]`), making it useful for finding specific moments in the video.
    *   **`ts_{video_title}_{lang}_final.md`**: The **final, AI-processed transcript**. This version has been fully translated (if a different target language was set) and reformatted. All time blocks are removed, and the text is structured into clean sentences and paragraphs, making it highly readable and perfect for use as a a source for further analysis.

*   **`audio/` Subdirectory (Optional):**
    *   If you run the command with the hidden `--extract-audio` flag, this directory will contain the downloaded `.mp3` audio file of the video, useful for offline listening or transcription with other tools.
