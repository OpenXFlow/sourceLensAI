# SourceLens "How-To" Guides

Welcome to the `sourceLens` "How-To" documentation hub. This collection of guides provides practical, step-by-step instructions for using, configuring, troubleshooting, and extending the tool.

---

## 1. Getting Started & Basic Usage

Guides for new users to get the application installed, configured, and running.

*   **[How to Run `sourceLens`](./how_to_run_sourceLens.md)**
    *   Learn the essential command-line syntax for `code` and `web` analysis, how to configure API keys, and how to troubleshoot common startup issues.

*   **[How to Interpret Code Analysis Output](./how_to_interpret_code_analysis_output.md)**
    *   A walkthrough of the files generated by the `code` flow, including the `index.md`, numbered chapters, diagrams, and project review.

*   **[How to Interpret Web Crawling Output](./how_to_interpret_web_crawling_output.md)**
    *   Explains the different outputs from the `web` flow, covering the `llm_extended` and `minimalistic` modes, and the specialized files for YouTube analysis.

## 2. Configuration & Customization

Dive deeper into the `config.json` file to tailor `sourceLens` to your specific needs.

*   **[How to Configure the Code Analysis Flow](./how_to_configure_code_analysis.md)**
    *   Customize the `FL01_code_analysis` flow. Learn to add new language profiles, switch LLMs, and optimize runs for cost and speed.

*   **[How to Configure the Web Crawling Flow](./how_to_configure_web_crawling.md)**
    *   Customize the `FL02_web_crawling` flow. Control crawler behavior, adjust content segmentation, and configure YouTube transcript processing.

*   **[How to Use Web Crawling Processing Modes](./how_to_use_processing_modes.md)**
    *   A detailed comparison of the `"minimalistic"` (archiving) and `"llm_extended"` (AI analysis) modes to help you choose the right one.

*   **[How to Analyze YouTube Content](./how_to_analyze_youtube_content.md)**
    *   A deep dive into the specialized workflow for analyzing YouTube videos, from transcript extraction and translation to audio downloading.

*   **[Understanding `pyproject.toml`](./how_to_project_toml.md)**
    *   An explanation of the project's central configuration file, detailing dependencies, build system, and tool settings.

## 3. For Developers: Extending `sourceLens`

Guides for contributors who want to add new functionality to the project.

*   **[How to Add a New Node to a Flow](./how_to_add_a_new_node_to_a_flow.md)**
    *   A step-by-step guide on creating a new processing node and integrating it into a pipeline, with examples for both `FL01` and `FL02`.

*   **[How to Add a New LLM Provider](./how_to_add_new_LLM_provider_to_sourceLens.md)**
    *   Learn the process for integrating a new third-party or local LLM provider into the application.

*   **[How to Add New Diagram Types](./how_to_add_more_diagrams_to_sourceLens.md)**
    *   Extend the diagram generation capabilities by adding new types of diagrams (e.g., Mind Maps) to the `GenerateDiagramsNode`.

*   **[How to Integrate an MPC LLM Interface](./how_to_integrate_MPC_LLM_interface.md)**
    *   An expert-level analysis of the architectural changes required to integrate `sourceLens` with a privacy-preserving Multi-Party Computation (MPC) system.

## 4. For Developers: Debugging and Packaging

Essential guides for troubleshooting the pipeline and preparing the application for distribution.

*   **[How to Analyze and Understand Logs](./how_to_analyze_and_understand_logs.md)**
    *   Learn to read the log files effectively, trace a successful run, and recognize common error patterns to quickly diagnose issues.

*   **[How to Debug and Troubleshoot the Pipeline](./how_to_debug_and_troubleshoot_the_pipeline.md)**
    *   Advanced techniques for debugging the pipeline, including inspecting the `shared_context`, isolating flows, and managing the LLM cache.

*   **[How to Work with Mermaid Diagrams](./how_to_Mermaid.md)**
    *   A guide on how to view the generated Mermaid diagrams and troubleshoot common syntax or rendering errors.

*   **[How to Create the `sourceLens` Package](./how_to_create_sorceLens_package.md)**
    *   Learn how to build distributable packages (wheels and source distributions) for deployment or sharing.
