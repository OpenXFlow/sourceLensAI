# SourceLens: Technical Documentation

Welcome to the technical documentation for the `sourceLens` project. This collection of documents provides an in-depth look at the project's architecture, processing flows, and overall design. It is intended for developers, architects, and contributors who wish to gain a deep understanding of how `sourceLens` works.

## Table of Contents

1.  **[Introduction and Architecture Overview](./1_introduction_and_architecture.md)**
    *   A high-level overview of the project's vision, design philosophy, and core components. Includes an architectural mind map and a detailed breakdown of the project's directory structure.

2.  **[Deep Dive: The Code Analysis Flow (`FL01`)](./2_code_analysis_flow_deep_dive.md)**
    *   An expert-level analysis of the `FL01_code_analysis` pipeline. This document details the purpose of each node in the flow and visualizes the process with detailed sequence diagrams, from initial configuration to final content generation.

3.  **[Deep Dive: The Web Crawling Flow (`FL02`)](./3_web_crawling_flow_deep_dive.md)**
    *   A comprehensive breakdown of the `FL02_web_crawling` pipeline. It explains the conditional logic for handling different web sources (general web vs. YouTube) and processing modes (`minimalistic` vs. `llm_extended`), complete with illustrative sequence diagrams.

4.  **[Project Evaluation](./4_project_evaluation.md)**
    *   A holistic and objective evaluation of the `sourceLens` project. This document assesses the project's strengths and weaknesses across its vision, functionality, and technical implementation, concluding with a weighted, scored assessment.
