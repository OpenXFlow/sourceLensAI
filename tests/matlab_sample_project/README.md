# MATLAB Sample Project: Signal Processing

This project demonstrates a simple workflow for generating, processing, and visualizing a noisy signal using both a functional and an object-oriented approach in MATLAB.

**Purpose:**
This project serves as a test case for the `sourceLens` analysis tool to evaluate its capability to document MATLAB codebases.

**Structure:**
- `main_analysis.m`: The main script that runs the entire analysis.
- `data/`: Contains data files and scripts to generate them.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions for data loading and processing.
- `plotting/`: Contains functions for visualization.
- `SignalProcessor.m`: An example of a custom class (`classdef`) for signal processing.
