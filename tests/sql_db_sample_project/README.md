# E-commerce Platform Database Schema

This project contains the SQL schema for a simplified e-commerce platform. It defines the tables, relationships, and business logic required to manage users, products, orders, and reviews.

## Database Schema
The schema is organized into several files for clarity:
- **`01_tables.sql`**: Defines the core tables of the database.
- **`02_constraints_and_indexes.sql`**: Adds primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes to optimize performance.
- **`03_views.sql`**: Creates simplified views for reporting and data analysis.
- **`04_procedures.sql`**: Contains stored procedures for common business operations.
- **`data/01_seed_data.sql`**: Contains sample data to populate the database for testing.
