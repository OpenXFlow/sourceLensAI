[dependencies]
# For logging (optional, but good practice)
# log = "0.4"
# env_logger = "0.10" # Or another logger implementation like fern, tracing

# For JSON parsing if we decide to load data from items.json (optional for this example)
# serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
# serde_json = "1.0"

# No external dependencies are strictly required for the initial direct port
# of the Python example's simulated data loading.
# Uncomment the above if you want to implement file I/O or advanced logging.

# [[bin]] # Optional: explicit binary definition if needed, usually inferred
# name = "rust_sample_project"
# path = "src/main.rs"
